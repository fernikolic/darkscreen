**Decoded Invoice Info:**
- Amount: 12,000 sats (~$12 USD)
- Timestamp: 2026-02-02T07:22:56 UTC
- Payment Hash: `13522a9c4bf2018377497c51df2365f67c78a670be441f6de38e3ad3bf5aea5b`

**Mint:**
- URL: https://mint.minibits.cash/Bitcoin
- Name: Minibits mint
- Version: Nutshell/0.18.2

## The Problem
The invoice was generated by the Minibits Cashu mint, but our system failed to store the quote ID (the identifier needed to claim the ecash proofs after payment). Without the quote ID, we cannot call `mintProofs()` to receive the Bitcoin.

Hi Minibits team,

I paid a Lightning invoice to your Cashu mint but lost the quote ID before I could claim the proofs.

Payment details:
- Invoice: lnbc120u1p5cq5xspp5zdfz48zt7gqcxa6f03ga7gm97e783fnshezp7m0r3cad8066afds...
- Payment Hash: 13522a9c4bf2018377497c51df2365f67c78a670be441f6de38e3ad3bf5aea5b
- Amount: 12,000 sats
- Timestamp: 2026-02-02T07:22:56 UTC

Could you either:
1. Provide the quote ID so I can claim the proofs, OR
2. Refund the payment if possible

Thank you!
```

### Option 2: Check Your Lightning Wallet
- Look at your transaction history
- If the payment shows as "pending" or "failed", the sats may still be in your wallet
- Lightning payments can take up to 24-48 hours to finalize or timeout

### Option 3: Wait for Expiry
- If the payment didn't actually complete, it will expire and the sats return to sender
- Cashu mint quotes typically expire in 24 hours

## Bug Fix Applied
The bug that caused this has been fixed in:
- `src/services/payments/index.ts` - Now stores `bolt11` and `amountSats` in deposit record
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added Cashu-specific fields to Deposit type

All future BTC Lightning deposits will properly store the invoice for recovery purposes.

## Prevention
Going forward:
1. All Lightning invoices are stored with the deposit record
2. The quote ID (used as deposit ID) can be matched to the invoice
3. Recovery scripts can find and claim paid deposits
