# Darkscreen — Full Context for LLMs

> Crypto product design library — screenshots, UI patterns, and visual competitive intelligence from 155+ wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols.

## About Darkscreen

Darkscreen is a product intelligence platform for crypto. We systematically screenshot every major crypto product, track how they change over time, and present visual competitive intelligence to product teams, founders, and designers.

Unlike generic design galleries, Darkscreen is focused exclusively on crypto products and provides structured, comparable data: same flows across different products, tagged UI elements, tracked changes, and organized by category, chain, and design style.
